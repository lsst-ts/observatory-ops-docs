Rubin Observatory Operations Documentation
##########################################

|

.. Important::

    This documentation area is under heavy development and only in the very early stages of design.
    It should not be used nor consulted for a place of information at this time.

Observatory Operations consists of multiple levels of interactions and procedures occurring simultaneously in many places and timezones.
This section of documentation focuses on the resources needed for observers, commissioning personnel, and support staff to facilitate night-time operations.


The scope of this area of documentation is to provide a centralized, version controlled space where resources are either located, or linked appropriately.
The content is provided as reference only.
All aspects of the project that go through strict change control (e.g. mirror procedures) should only be linked to these pages.


Daytime/Nighttime Interactions
==============================
- This area of contains information related to summit operations, specifically nighttime activities and the handoff to/from daytime personnel

- This also includes the mechanism to facilitate daytime work by the night crew (e.g. diagnose a re-occurring fault)

- Nightlog instructions


Observing Interface Setup
=========================

- Information on getting setup for observations - also tools etc

Observing Constraints
=====================

- Describes different physical and meteorogical factors that affect operation (e.g. opening/closing)

Operational Procedures
======================

Content in this section procedures related to regular night-time operations (e.g. opening/closing, troubleshooting)

Safety
======

Content in this section relates to personnel safety and resources.
This includes:

- procedures on who (and how) to call when there is an issue
- location of keys, passwords etc
- what to do in case of vehicle failure, power-outage, fire etc.
- Procedures to enter telescope spaces during operations (e.g. AuxTel)
- Emergency meeting locations etc.


Project Documentation Information
=================================

- Describes information regarding this documentation tree, including how to contribute.
