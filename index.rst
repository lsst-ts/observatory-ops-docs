- This also includes the mechanism to facilitate daytime work by the night crew (e.g. diagnose a re-occurring fault)


Observating Interface Setup
===========================

- Information on getting setup for observations - also tools etc


Operational Constraints
=======================

- Describes different physical and meteorogical factors that affect operation (e.g. opening/closing)

Operational Procedures
======================

- Describes procedures related to regular night-time operations (e.g. opening/closing, troubleshooting)
