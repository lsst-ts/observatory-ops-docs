.. _AuxTel-ATHexapod-Fails-to-Enable-with-the-rest-of-ATCS-Solution:

Solution
========

The connection to the ATHexapod can be recovered by manually rebooting the ATHexapod controller box located in the ATCS cabinet in the pier of the AuxTel dome.


.. _AuxTel-ATHexapod-Fails-to-Enable-with-the-rest-of-ATCS-Procedure-Critical-Step-1:

1. Announce in the slack channel #summit-anounce that you are going to the AuxTel building to reboot the ATHexapod Controller.
   
2. On the first level, or pier of the AuxTel dome, open the Main ATCS cabinet and press the off button at the C-887 Hexapod Controller, that's located at the bottom of the cabinet.

   .. figure:: ./_static/ATHexapod_Controller.jpg
       :name: ATHexapodCtrl
       :scale: 20 %

       ATHexapod Controller.

3. Wait 3 minutes.
4. Turn the controller on again.
5. The ATHexapod CSC should be now in ``STANDBY``. Transition the ATHexapod from the ASummaryState View ``STANDBY`` → ``START`` → ``ENABLE``, or alternative , you could run the `auxtel/enable_atcs.py` again ATCS should be ready now to begin operations.
6. Fill the ticket `OBS-243 - ATHexapod not enabling with the rest of ATCS <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/OBS-243>`__ with as much information you have regarding the state of the system, such as procedures or maintenance done prior to this failure (e-stop, mirror CO2 cleaning, power outage, LOTO, etc)
