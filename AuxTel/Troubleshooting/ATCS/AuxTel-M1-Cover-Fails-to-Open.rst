.. _AuxTel-M1-Cover-Fails-To-Open-Overview:

Overview
========

This procedure explains the steps to follow when AuxTel M1 Cover fails to open during daytime checkout or at the start of night.

Error Diagnosis
===============

This is possible following any daytime work which involves manually controlling the M1 Covers on AuxTel, such as the weekly C02 mirror cleaning.

:file:`auxtel/daytime_checkout/atpneumatics_checkout.py` fails with:

Post-Condition
==============

This procedure leaves the telescope with the M1 cover open.

.. _AuxTel-M1-Cover-Fails-To-Open-Procedure:

Procedure Steps
===============

The recovery of the M1 cover control must be done from the *ATMCS EUI*.

#. **Ensure the ATCS CSCs are all set to STANDBY**

   The easiest way to do this is to run the :file:`standby_atcs.py` script from the *ATQueue*.
   Do not proceed to the next step until the CSCs are set to ``STANDBY``, otherwise you will need to reset both the CSC and EUI to regain communication. 

#. **Log in to the ATMCS EUI** either using a remote desktop or from the control computer on the first floor of the AuxTel dome. 

   More instruction can be found in the :ref:`access ATMCS EUI procedure <AuxTel-Non-Standard-Operations-AuxTel-EUI-Access>`. 

#. **Close the ATMCS EUI tab** 

#. **Engage E-stop in main AT Control Cabinet and ATDome Main Box** located on the first floor. 

#. **Release E-stop starting with the ATDome Main Box, followed by the AT Control Cabinet**. 
   
   Refer to :ref:`release E-stop procedure <E-Stop-Procedure-How-Engage-Disengage-E-stop-System>` for more details. 

#. **Open LSST Auxiliary Telescope MCS & Pneumatics EUI ATMCS** in the web-browser.    

   Address is *http://139.229.170.47:8000/atmcs.html*
  
#. Select **Request Control of VI** in the menu that opens with the mouse's right button to gain control of the GUI. 

#. **Change to** *M1 Covers* **tab**.  

    .. figure:: /AuxTel/Troubleshooting/ATCS/_static/ATMCS_M1Covers.png
      
      ATMCS EUI *M1 Covers* tab   

#. Under *M1 Covers Commands* click :guilabel:`start` followed by :guilabel:`enable` will give you **control of the M1 Covers** opening and closing mechanism. 

#. Press :guilabel:`open` to confirm **M1 covers are opening correctly**. 

   The LED lights marked *C1OP, C2OP, C3OP, and C4OP* (corresponding to the numbers of the four cover petals) will illuminate as each petal opens.
   Petal #3 is the final petal to open and close. 

#. To **allow CSC remote control**, close the M1 covers first by clicking :guilabel:`close` button. 
   Indicators *C1CL* to *C4CL* will now turn on. 
    
   Continue with :guilabel:`disable` and :guilabel:`standby` in the *M1 Covers Commands* section. 
   
   Finally **Release Control of VI** in the mouse's right-click menu.
