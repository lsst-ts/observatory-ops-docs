.. Do not remove other content provided in the templates, such as a section. Instead, comment out the content and include comments to explain the situation. For example:
	- If a section within the template is not needed, comment out the section title and label reference. Include a comment explaining why this is not required.
    - If a file cannot include a title (surrounded by ampersands (#)), comment out the title from the template and include a comment explaining why this is implemented (in addition to applying the ``title`` directive).

.. Include one Primary Author and list of Contributors (comma separated) between the asterisks (*):

ATHexapod Position Out of Limits

.. _ATHexapod-Fails-Out-of-Limits-Overview:

Overview
========

When running scripts that require ATAOS corrections (e.g., :file:`atpneumatics_checkout.py` or :file:`enable_ataos_corrections.py`, 
ATHexapod may fail to apply corrections due to its position being outside of the limits.

.. _ATHexapod-Fails-Out-of-Limits-Error-Diagnosis:

Error diagnosis
===============

1.  ATHexapod CSC produces the following error in its message log:

    .. code-block:: text
      :caption: ATHexapod CSC Error Message

      Position out of limits (7)
  

2.  Should the ATAOS CSC go into ``FAULT``, the following error will display in from the 
    current script in ATQueue:

    .. code-block:: python
      :caption: ATAOS Script Failure Message

          File
      "/opt/lsst/software/stack/conda/envs/lsst-scipipe-9.0.0/lib/python3.11/site-
      packages/lsst/ts/salobj/topics/remote_command.py", line 191, in next_ackcmd
          raise
      base.AckError(msg="Command failed", ackcmd=ackcmd) lsst.ts.salobj.base.AckError: msg='Command
      failed', ackcmd=(ackcmd private_seqNum=493863606, ack=<SalRetCode.CMD_FAILED: -302>, error=1,
      result="Failed: disableCorrection not allowed in Fault state: errorCode=8103,
      errorReport='Correction loop died.'")

    And the ATAOS CSC produces the following error in its message log:

    .. code-block:: text
      :caption: ATAOS CSC Error Message

      Correction loop died.

.. _ATHexapod-Fails-Out-of-Limits-Procedure-Steps:

Procedure Steps
===============


.. _ATHexapod-Fails-Out-of-Limits-Procedure-Case-1:

Case 1: Only ATHexapod Faults
-----------------------------

1.  Reset the position of the ATHexapod loading a :file:`run_command.py` SAL script 
    into ATQueue with the following configuration::
      
      component: ATHexapod
      cmd: moveToPosition
      parameters:
        x: 0
        y: 0
        z: 0
        u: 0
        v: 0
        w: 0

2.  Load :file:`enable_ataos_corrections.py` to re-enable the ATAOS corrections.

    - Run this script only at **high elevations** :math:`(\geq 70^\circ)`.

3.  Verify ATHexapod is operating properly by running :file:`atpneumatics_checkout.py`.


.. _ATHexapod-Fails-Out-of-Limits-Procedure-Case-1:

Case 2: ATHexapod & ATAOS Fail
------------------------------

1.  Send ATAOS CSC to ``OFFLINE`` using the :file:`set_summary_state.py` script 
    with the following configuration::

        data:
          - [ATAOS, OFFLINE]

2.  Reset the ATAOS CSC on ArgoCD by following the instructions for :ref:`Restoring a CSC from the OFFLINE state <troubleshooting-component-offline>`.

    - Contact another scientist on Slack (`#summit-auxtel <https://rubin-obs.slack.com/archives/C07Q45NUK4P>`_) for assistance.

3.  Send ATAOS CSC back to ``ENABLED`` with another :file:`set_summary_state.py` 
    script::

      data:
        - [ATAOS, ENABLED]

4.  Load :file:`enable_ataos_corrections.py` to re-enable the ATAOS corrections.

    - Run this script only at **high elevations** :math:`(\geq 70^\circ)`.


5.  Verify ATHexapod is operating properly by running :file:`atpneumatics_checkout.py`.


.. _ATHexapod-Fails-Out-of-Limits-Post-Condition:

Post-Condition
==============

- The ATHexapod and ATAOS CSCs are successfully in the ``ENABLED`` state.
- ATAOS corrections are enabled without causing faults to the CSCs.
- The ATCS system is fully operational and ready to proceed with observations or further procedures.


.. _ATHexapod-Fails-Out-of-Limits-Contingency:

Contingency
===========

If the procedure was not successful, report the issue in `#summit-auxtel <https://rubin-obs.slack.com/archives/C07Q45NUK4P>`_ and/or activate the :ref:`Out of hours support <Safety-out-of-hours-support>`.
