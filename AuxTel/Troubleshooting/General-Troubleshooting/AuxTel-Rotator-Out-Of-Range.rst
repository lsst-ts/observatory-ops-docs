script failed with the error message:

.. code-block:: text

    Rejected: Rotator out of range. Target in rotator limit (-170 to 170 degrees) but out of slew limit margin (1 degs).

and *ATPtg* might goes into ``FAULT``.

Error diagnosis
===============

During the imaging or spectroscopic surveys, :file:`latiss_acquire` (Spectroscopic survey) or :file:`track_target_and_take_image` (Imaging survey)

.. _AuxTel-Rotator-Out-Of-Range-Procedure-Steps:

Procedure Steps
===============

The interim solution requires recovering the *ATPtg* back to ``ENABLED`` in the case it went to ``FAULT``, and skipping to the next target in the ATQueue 
by pressing the :guilabel:`PLAY` button. 
If this script also fails with the same error, wait three minutes and try again.


#. Recover *ATPtg* from ``FAULT`` state: Transition the *ATPtg* *CSC* from LOVE ASummaryState through the states, ``FAULT`` → ``STANDBY`` → ``START`` → ``ENABLED``.
#. Add a :file:`auxtel/correct_pointing.py` script to the top of the queue to recover the pointing offsets from the beginning of the night. No configuration is needed, you can use the default configuration.  
#. Press :guilabel:`PLAY` button in the ATQueue: This will skip to the next target waiting in the queue.
#. If this "new" script fails as well, wait three minutes and repeat 1-2 again.
#. Log in relevant information about this failure in the ticket `OBS-52 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/OBS-52>`__.


Alternative Procedure
=====================

In case the previous steps did not work, rotator continues failing and *ATPtg* never went to ``FAULT`` state, there is an alternative solution as follows. 

#. Track a new target placing the standard script :file:`auxtel/track_target.py` at the top of the queue. 
   Use the following configuration:
   
   .. code-block:: text
    :caption: track_target.py

    az: 90.0
    el: 60.0
    mag_limit: 8.0

#. Continue adding :file:`auxtel/correct_pointing.py` as in step 2 of previous procedure with the following configuration:

   .. code-block:: text
    :caption: correct_pointing.py

    az: 90.0
    el: 60.0

#. Press :guilabel:`PLAY` button in the ATQueue.

#. Log in relevant information about this failure in the ticket `OBS-52 <https://rubinobs.atlassian.net/browse/OBS-52>`__.


.. _AuxTel-Rotator-Out-Of-Range-Post-Condition:

Post-Condition
==============

- *ATPtg* is back to the ``ENABLED`` state.
- The rotator is within the acceptable range for operations.
- No further "Rotator out of range" errors occur after executing the procedure.
