This page defines the different types of operational constraints.

Operating conditions used to define the Rubin construction project are found in `LTS-54 <ls.st/lts-54>`__.

As commissioning gets underway the operating conditions will be better constrained and different situations will apply to the Main telescope and Auxiliary Telescope.


Unrestricted Operating Conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Winds less than X km/h


Restricted Observing Conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Winds greater than X km/h
Relative humidity greater than X%
Dust count?

Vent Gate Configurations
------------------------

Operations must be at elevations> Y degrees.

Moon Avoidance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
