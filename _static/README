This README includes information on using static objects within the top-level directory.

To add images, add the image file (png, svg or jpeg preferred) to this /_static/ directory. The reST syntax for adding the image from the top-level directory is:

.. figure:: _static/filename.ext
    :name: fig-label
    :target: http://target.link/url

    Caption text.

The README in lower level /_static/ directories should include instructions for static objects within that directory.
