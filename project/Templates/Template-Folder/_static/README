This is a template _static/README file for a directory in the procedure's arm of the documentation. This line may be deleted when the template folder is copied to the destination.

This README includes information on using static objects within this directory.

To add images, add the image file (png, svg or jpeg preferred) to this /_static/ directory. The reST syntax for adding the image is:

.. figure:: ./_static/filename.ext
    :name: fig-label
    :target: http://target.link/url

    Caption text.

Symbolic links can be used for common static objects:

1. Create a symbolic link in the _static folder of the lower level directory. (Syntax: $ln -s [TARGET] LINK_NAME)

   $ ln -s ../../_static/filename.ext EXAMPLE_LINK

2. The reST syntax for adding the linked image is:

.. figure:: ./_static/EXAMPLE_LINK
    :name: fig-label

    Caption text.
