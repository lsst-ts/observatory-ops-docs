The Nublado Platform
####################

The nublado platform is the initial entry point for users to interact with the Rubin Observatory control system.
It is highly flexible, allowing you to work on one or more components to accomplish both, high and low level operations.

A jupyter-lab environment is provided for users to launch notebooks. By default, the platform provides a set of environments with released software versions and tools, including:

- the `LSST stack <https://pipelines.lsst.io>`__, 
- interfaces (*e.g.*, `xml <https://ts-xml.lsst.io/>`__, `IDL <https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_idl>`__, `SAL <https://ts-sal.lsst.io/>`__, `Salobj <https://ts-salobj.lsst.io/>`__), and
- high-level control algorithms (*e.g.*, `ATCS <https://ts-observatory-control.lsst.io/>`__, LATISS, MTCS, ComCam).
