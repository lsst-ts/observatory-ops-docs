#. Create a virtual environment (if you haven't already):

   .. code-block:: bash

      python3 -m venv .venv
      source .venv/bin/activate

   **Tip:** activate this virtual environment in another shell by re-running the ``source`` command.

#. Install dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

#. Build the site:

   .. code-block:: bash

      make html

   Open ``_build/html/index.html`` in a browser to review it.

#. To completely clear the build:

   .. code-block:: bash

      make clean

#. To check links:

   .. code-block:: bash

      make linkcheck

   If some links are behind a login, you might need to ignore them.
   Look at the ``linkcheck_ignore`` variable in ``conf.py`` for examples of how to do this.
