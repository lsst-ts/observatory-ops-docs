Simonyi LOTO Procedure
######################

.. _Simonyi-LOTO-procedure-Overview:

Overview
========

.. This section should provide a brief, top-level description of the procedure's purpose and utilization. Consider including the expected user and when the procedure will be performed.

This document describes how to prevent any telescope movement as a safety measure through **Lock-Out-Tag-Out** (**LOTO**) 
procedure. To perform this procedure, LOTO training must have been received. Observers during operations may be 
expected to LOTO the **Telescope Main Assembly** (**TMA**) due to unforeseen work done at night. The TMA LOTO is done directly 
in the **Oil Supply System** (**OSS**).



.. _Simonyi-LOTO-procedure-Precondition:

Precondition
============

.. This section should provide simple overview of preconditions before executing the procedure; for example, state of equipment, telescope or seeing conditions or notifications prior to execution.
.. It is preferred to include them as a bulleted or enumerated list.
.. If there is a different procedure that is critical before execution, carefully consider if it should be linked within this section or as part of the Procedure section below (or both).

.. warning::

    To perform this procedure formal LOTO training must have been received; refer also to 
    the `TMA LOTO Procedure video. <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rOvu1ITDCm0HNepfvoBWMzhGZkMPkKnH/view>`_ 

.. _Simonyi-LOTO-procedure-Procedure-Steps:

Procedure Steps
===============

.. This section should include the procedure. There is no strict formatting or structure required for procedures. It is left to the authors to decide which format and structure is most relevant.
.. In the case of more complicated procedures, more sophisticated methodologies may be appropriate, such as multiple section headings or a list of linked procedures to be performed in the specified order.
.. For highly complicated procedures, consider breaking them into separate procedure. Some options are a high-level procedure with links, separating into smaller procedures or utilizing the reST ``include`` directive <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#include>.


Applying LOTO on OSS
--------------------

.. note::

    **LOTO box**
    
    Keys and locks are inside the LOTO Box. You can find LOTO box (with a tag "Electronic team" on the box) on 
    Level 1 in the OSS room. If you cannot find or open that LOTO box, you can take a LOTO box from the meeting room 
    on Level 2.

#.  **Announcement**: Before/right after applying LOTO on the OSS, announce "LOTO on the OSS" on  *#summit-announce* and/or *#summit-simonyi*.

#.  **Turning off the OSS**: Turn :guilabel:`OFF` the OSS in the EUI panel (indicated by the :gold:`circle` in the following Figure)

     Figure 1: The :guilabel:`OSS GENERAL VIEW` in the TMA EUI can be accessed by entering the :guilabel:`MONITOR & CONTROL` > :guilabel:`MAIN AXES` tab in the left vertical menu panel of the EUI. 

#.  **Wait until the OSS is off**:  the :guilabel:`status` turns `Idle` and :guilabel:`OSS` flag goes from green to gray. 
    It takes around 5-10 minutes to complete turning off the OSS.

#.  **Applying LOTO on the OSS Pump**: Go to the OSS room from Level 1 (first floor). Apply LOTOs on the OSS pump switches (highlighted by the :red:`box` in
    the following Figure). Close valves (Position "â€”-") and put locks on the holes to apply three LOTOs on the safety 
    switches of the OSS pumps.

Unlocking LOTO on OSS
---------------------

#.  Go to the the OSS room and remove the locks from the pump switches. Find the key for each lock from the LOTO box 
    and match the number on the key and the lock. 

#.  Put the LOTO locks with the keys back into the LOTO box.

#.  Open the switches (Position "|") on the pump (See the Figure 5 below).

     Figure 5

#.  Turn on the OSS from TMA EUI (**Optional**). 

#.  Announce the status of the OSS on  *#summit-announce* and/or *#summit-simonyi*.

.. note::

    **LOTO at night**

    During night-time operations, only **ONE** pump needs to be locked 
    to consider the TMA fully under LOTO. This helps to move the process faster by taking into consideration the 
    reduced on-summit personnel (~ 2 persons operation at night) and mitigating situations like when one cannot find the LOTO boxes, risk of losing 
    multiple locks + keys, leaving lights on longer etc.




.. _Simonyi-LOTO-procedure-Post-Condition:

Post-Condition
==============

.. This section should provide a simple overview of conditions or results after executing the procedure; for example, state of equipment or resulting data products.
.. It is preferred to include them as a bulleted or enumerated list.
.. Please provide screenshots of the software status or relevant display windows to confirm.
.. Do not include actions in this section. Any action by the user should be included in the end of the Procedure section below. For example: Do not include "Verify the telescope azimuth is 0 degrees with the appropriate command." Instead, include this statement as the final step of the procedure, and include "Telescope is at 0 degrees." in the Post-condition section.

#.  **After applying LOTO on OSS** 
    Telescope is unable to move. OSS is under LOTO shows :guilabel:`status` as `Idle` and the three pumps in :red:`red`, down to the left in the image.

#.  **After unlocking LOTO on OSS** 

    -   OSS idle but not turned on (:red:`Need Figure`)

    -   OSS turned on after removing LOTO  (:red:`Need Figure`)

Contingency
===========

Announce the status of locking and unlocking the LOTO in *#summit-simonyi* and/or *#summit-announce* and/or activate 
the `Out of hours support <https://obs-ops.lsst.io/Safety/out-of-hours-support.html#safety-out-of-hours-support>`_.
