Overview
========

The emergency stop procedure plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety of Rubin Observatory. 
It is typically used in emergency situations or as a safety measure. 
It works by cutting off the electrical power to the various components of the telescope, 
including the mount and dome, which stops them from being moved either by software commands or manually.

The emergency stop can be triggered by users in certain circumstances, but it can also be activated automatically in the event of strong earthquakes 
(currently not implemented), as well as in response to safety interlocks and software-based emergencies. 
While the primary objective of the emergency E-stop procedure is to provide a quick and reliable means of halting the movement of the telescope and dome to avoid accidents and injuries, 
it also serves the purpose of safeguarding the system.

Below you will find a brief overview of the emergency stop procedure, covering:

=========================================

**Engaging** the emergency stop system is a straightforward process that is both efficient and reliable. 
To trigger it, simply **push the big red button**. 
This will be enough to stop halt the telescope and avoid it from accidental/unexpected movements.
