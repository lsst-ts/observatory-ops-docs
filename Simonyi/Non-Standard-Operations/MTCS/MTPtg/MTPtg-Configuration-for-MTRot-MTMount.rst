MTPtg Configuration for MTRotator and MTMount
#############################################

**Important Information before start.**

.. warning:: 

    Only proceed if you are authorized to change the configuration of the pointing component *MTPtg* of the Simonyi Telescope.

..

.. warning:: 

    Commissioning Scientists (ComSci) or Observing Specialist (OS) with the ArgoCD training and authorized on shift can change the version of *MTMount CSC* in *ArgoCD* to **mtmount-ccw-only**. 
    This configurations can deal with tracking without said component.
..

.. note:: 
    
    A precondition to this procedure, is the *MTMount CSC* should be configured in the proper *CSC version* to be operational (only with the *CCW* component). 
    This is done by the ComSci or the OS in ArgoCD (`Instructions for ArgoCD`_). 

    They may/will request to send the *MTMount* to ``OFFLINE`` status before changing the *MTMount CSC version* to **mtmount-ccw-only**. 
    Follow their instructions. 

    To check the *CSC version* in use, you can open ArgoCD (credentials in 1Password) and search for *simoniyitel*. 
    The figure shows this page, highlighting the **Synced** status indicating is in this state.

.. _MTMTPtg-Configuration-for-MTRotator-and-MTMount-Procedure-Overview:
Overview
========

When either the **MTRotator** or **MTMount** components become unavailable during Simonyi operations, and you still want to continue testing and tracking, it's necessary to change the configuration of the **MTPtg** CSC to avoid entering into ``FAULT`` mode .


.. _MTMTPtg-Configuration-for-MTRotator-and-MTMount-Procedure-Error-Precondition:
Precondition
===============

1. **MTRotator** is not available, but you still want to track **without** the Rotator, using the rest of the components; or you want to **include** the Rotator in the tracking again. 
2. **MTMount** is not available (not starting up, for example), but you still want to use *CCW+Rotator* **without** moving or commanding the mount, or you want to revert the change and **include** the mount.


.. _MTMTPtg-Configuration-for-MTRotator-and-MTMount-Procedure-Procedure-Steps:
Procedure Steps
===============

Steps
-----
1. Announce through the Slack channel *#summit-simonyi* that the component is not available, and you are about to change the configuration.

2. Issue the :file:`set_summary_state.py` script in LOVE to change the status of *MTPtg* to ``STANDBY`` with the following configuration

    .. code-block::
        :caption: set_summary_state.py

             data:
                 -
                   - MTPtg 
                   - STANDBY
..


3. Find the name of the **pod** where the *MTPtg* is running. 
   
    From your terminal, run the following command which list all the pods related to the simonyitel  :

    .. prompt:: bash
        
        kubectl --kubeconfig=${HOME}/.kube/yagan.yaml get pod -o=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,STATUS:.status.phase,NODE:.spec.nodeName -n simonyitel

    ..

    If you get a :kbd:`command_not_found`, you first need to set up docker. Follow the `Instructions for Kubernetes`_ in step #4.

    .. figure:: ./_static/1.png
      :width: 480px
      :height: 300px
      :name: Your figure

      Fig3. In this particular case the name of the *MTPtg* **pod** is **mtptg-nss2j**, the name changed constantly *(mtptg-xxxxx)*.
    ..  

4. Connect to the *MTPtg* **pod mtptg-nss2j** within the **simonyitel**. The command bellow will open a terminal within the pod as **saluser**.

    .. prompt:: bash
    
      kubectl --kubeconfig=${HOME}/.kube/yagan.yaml exec --stdin --tty mtptg-nss2j -n simonyitel -- /bin/bash
    
    ..
   

5. Configuration directory: the configuration files are one level up.  

    .. prompt:: bash

      cd /home/saluser/repos/ts_pointing_common/install/data

    ..
    
    .. figure:: ./_static/3.png
       :width: 850px
       :height: 360px

       Fig4. The directory contains the configuration files :file:`MTPtg.info` and the pointing models :file:`mt.mod` files. 
   
    ..

    .. note:: 
    
        At startup, the pointing component loads by default the pointing model that's on the :file:`mt.mod` file and the :file:`MTPtg.info`.
    ..


6. Edit the :file:`MTPtg.info` file, use a text editor such as *vi*. 

    6.1. Edit the **disable_rotator** paramenter in the :file:`MTPtg.info` file.

    - set 1 : rotator will be **ignored** and will not be commanded by the *MTPtg* component (disabled). 
    - set 0 : rotator will be **included** (enabled)


    .. code-block:: 
        :caption: MTPtg.info / disable_rotator  - Disabled example

            disable_rotator: 1
    ..


    6.2. Edit The **disable_mount** parameter in the :file:`MTPtg.info` file. 

    - set 1 : mount will be **ignored** and will not be commanded by the *MTPtg* component (disabled). 
    - set 0 : mount will be **included** (enabled).

    .. code-block:: 
        :caption: MTPtg.info / disable_mount - Enabled example

            disable_mount: 0
    ..


7. **Exit** the **pod** by typing :command:`exit`.

8. Send the *MTPtg* to ``ENABLED`` using the script :file:`set_summary_state.py` and configuration below in the MTQueue.

    Note: *MTMount* must be ``ENABLED``, even if not tracking, so *CCW* can be still monitored.

    .. code-block::
        :caption: set_summary_state.py

             data:
                 -
                   - MTPtg 
                   - ENABLED
..


.. _MTRotator-or-MTMount-Configuration-Procedure-Post-Condition:

Post-Condition
==============

1. The tracking tests are able to run with a missing component, either *MTMount* or *MTRotator*, if the respective parameter was set to **1**.

2. The tracking tests includes the *MTMount* or *MTRotator*, if the respective parameter was set to **0**.  

3. Once you finish with the procedure, the parameters need to be restored to their original state.


.. _MTRotator-or-MTMount-Configuration-Procedure-Contingency:

Contingency
===========
* If the procedure is not successful, report the issue in *#summit-simonyi*, inform the Commissioning Scientist on duty, and/or activate the `Out of Hours Support`_.
