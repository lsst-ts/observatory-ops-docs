This README includes information on contributing to this directory.

The Simulation Environments directory is separated into two independent sub-directories:
  - Tucson Test Stand
  - Base Test Stand

Content common to both should be help on the parent page(s).

Contributing:
 - Refer to the respective README and /_static/README for contributing in each location.
 - Operational-Procedures/_static/ can be used for shared static objects between these two locations.

See https://obs-ops.lsst.io/project/contributing.html for details on contributing to the documents.
