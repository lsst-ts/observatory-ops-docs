Overview
^^^^^^^^

This section should give a top level description of what this procedure is for and when it should be performed.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section should list the prerequisites (e.g. required conditions) to perform the procedure. If multiple sentences/conditions are required this should be presented in bullet form.

- This is an example bullet (e.g. Telescope azimuth must be at 0 degrees)

    - This is a sub-bullet (e.g. Telescope elevation position is not important)


Post-Condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes the state of the system after performing the procedure. If multiple sentences/conditions are required this should be presented in bullet form.

- This procedure leaves the telescope with the E-stop activated.

    - Add Extra-guidance when required/useful. (e.g. De-activate the E-stop to re-activate the system, see Procedure XYZ)



Procedure Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This paragraph describes for the format of the procedure. This is optional as the usefulness depends upon the complexity of the procedure.

In the case of a very straightforward procedure, a simple numbered list could be used, like as follows:

#. This is Step in a numbered list
#. This is step two.


Separate into Subsections
-------------------------

In the case of more complicated procedures, more sophisticated methodologies may be appropriate, such as using multiple section headings, then numbered lists under each heading.
