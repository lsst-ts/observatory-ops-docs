.. _Deployment-Activities-Summit-LOVE-Summary:

LOVE Summary View
-----------------

The overall system summary state view is called ``ASummary State View``.

.. _Deployment-Activities-Summit-DM-Camera-Shutdown:

Shutdown DM and Camera Services
-------------------------------

* Shutdown/Cleanup daemon on Archiver machines:
    * *docker stop ospl-daemon*
    * *docker rm ospl-daemon*
* Shutdown Camera OCS Bridges:
    * ATCamera: *sudo systemctl stop ocs-bridge-atcamera.service*
    * CCCamera: *sudo systemctl stop ocs-bridge-comcam.service*
* Shutdown Camera Daemons
    * *sudo systemctl stop opensplice.service*
    * Command is the same everywhere.

.. _Deployment-Activities-Summit-LOVE-Shutdown:

Shutdown LOVE
-------------

This needs to be done from amor01.

* Uses the ``docker-compose-admin`` scripts in ``summit/amor01`` directory.
    * *./shutdown_love*
    * *./shutdown_daemon*

If LOVE2 is operating, go to amor02.

* Uses the ``docker-compose-admin`` scripts in ``summit/amor02`` directory.
    * *./shutdown_love*
    * *./shutdown_daemon*

.. _Deployment-Activities-Summit-TandS-BM-Shutdown:

Shutdown T&S Bare Metal Services
--------------------------------

Handle azar2:

* Uses the ``docker-compose-admin`` scripts in ``summit/azar2`` directory.
    * *./shutdown_eas*
    * *./shutdown_daemon*

Handle AT systems (ATMCS and ATPneumatics):

* *ssh admin@139.229.170.47*
* *vim /usr/ts_ddsconfig/config/ospl-shmem.xml*
* Line 4: replace 0 with 2 in the <Id> tag.
* *reboot && exit*

Handle M1M3 cRIO:

* *ssh admin@139.229.178.182*
* */etc/init.d/ts-M1M3support stop*

Handle M1M3 VMS cRIO:

* *ssh admin@139.229.178.183*
* */etc/init.d/ts-VMS stop*

Handle M2 VMS cRIO:

* *ssh admin@139.229.178.193*
* */etc/init.d/ts-VMS stop*

Handle M1M3 Dev & Test:

* ssh to those machines.
* *ps wuax | grep splice*
* *sudo kill <PID>* on any processes turned up by the previous command.

Handle Hexpod/Rotator (hexrot):

* Uses the ``docker-compose-admin`` scripts in ``summit/hexrot`` directory.
    * *./shutdown_hexrot*
    * *./shutdown_daemon*

AT PMD (at-keener):

* Uses ``docker-compose-ops``, so should be similar to hexrot (just doesn't have ``docker-compose-admin`` scripts).

M2 Control:

* ssh to that machine.
* *ps wuax | grep splice*
* *sudo kill <PID>* on any processes turned up by the previous command.

.. _Deployment-Activities-Summit-Kubernetes:

Interacting with Kubernetes
---------------------------

Commands can be executed from your own machine with *kubectl* and the proper kubeconfig file.

.. _Deployment-Activities-Summit-Main-Daemon-Shutdown:

Shutdown Main Daemon
--------------------

This needs to be done from azar1.

* Uses the ``docker-compose-admin`` scripts in ``summit/azar1`` directory.
    * *./shutdown_daemon*

.. _Deployment-Activities-Summit-Update-Configuration:

Update Configuration
--------------------

* Gather the branch for the configurations and version number for ``ts_ddsconfig``.
* Uses the ``docker-compose-admin`` scripts in ``summit`` directory.
* Directories to update:
    * ``/deploy-lsstts/docker-compose-ops`` (azar1, azar2, amor01, amor02)
    * ``/deploy-lsstts/ts_ddsconfig`` (azar1, azar2, amor01, amor02)
    * ``/deploy-lsstts/LOVE-integration-tools`` (amor01, amor02)
    * *sudo ./update_repo <repo path> <branch or version>*
* This will fail if the branch has local modifications. At that point you may as well just do the job manually. Here is one way to do that:
    * *cd /deploy-lsstts/<problem directory>*
    * *git status*
    * *sudo git reset --hard origin/<current ticket branch>*
    * Return to the ``docker-compose-admin`` scripts and run the *update_repo* command again.

.. _Deployment-Activities-Summit-Main-Daemon-Startup:

Startup Main Daemon
-------------------

This needs to be done from azar1.

* Uses the ``docker-compose-admin`` scripts in ``summit/azar1`` directory.
    * *./launch_daemon*

.. _Deployment-Activities-Summit-LOVE-Startup:

Startup LOVE
-------------

This needs to be done from amor01.

* Uses the ``docker-compose-admin`` scripts in ``summit/amor01`` directory.
    * *./launch_daemon*
    * Ensure daemon is ready before proceeding.
    * *./launch_love*

If LOVE2 is operating, go to amor02.

* Uses the ``docker-compose-admin`` scripts in ``summit/amor02`` directory.
    * *./launch_daemon*
    * Ensure daemon is ready before proceeding.
    * *./launch_love*

.. _Deployment-Activities-Summit-TandS-BM-Startup:

Startup T&S Bare Metal Services
-------------------------------

Handle azar2:

* Uses the ``docker-compose-admin`` scripts in ``summit/azar2`` directory.
    * *./launch_daemon*
    * Ensure daemon is ready before proceeding.
    * *./launch_eas*

Handle Hexapod/Rotator (hexrot):

* Uses the ``docker-compose-admin`` scripts in ``summit/hexrot`` directory.
    * *./launch_daemon*
    * Ensure daemon is ready before proceeding
    * *./launch_hexrot*

.. _Deployment-Activities-Summit-Enabled-CSCs:

Enabled CSCs
------------

There are a few CSCs that must be put into ENABLED state before declaring an end to the deployment.
These are:

* Watcher
* ScriptQueue:1
* ScriptQueue:2
* WeatherStation:1

The ScriptQueues can be started in the LOVE Queue view.
Click the cog wheel next to the Summary State display to chose Disable.
Click the cog wheel next to the Summary State display to chose Enable.

The Watcher and WeatherStation:1 can be started by using the ``set_summary_state..py`` script once the ScriptQueues are ENABLED.
Both systems require specific configuration settings for optimal operation.
They are:
* Watcher - summit
* WeatherStation:1 - default
