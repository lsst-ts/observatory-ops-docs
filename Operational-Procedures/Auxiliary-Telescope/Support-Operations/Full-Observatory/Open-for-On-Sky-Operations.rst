Overview
^^^^^^^^
This procedure takes the telescope from the nominal state of how it was (most likely) left at the end of the day, to getting the telescope fully open and ready to take observations. This includes things like enabling all components, opening the dome, mirror covers etc.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Assumes observatory is fully ready to operate, as would be the case if it was shutdown the night before using the shutdown procedure.




Post-Condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Telescope will be left read to observe.

- It is recommended to try slewing and taking an image to ensure all functionality is operational. Because the telescope and dome is positioned optimally away from the sun, only a very small (~3 degree) slew in azimuth should be performed.

Running this procedure via the scriptQueue is not currently implemented.

Open using example Notebook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the end of the day, before observations starts, most telescope-related CSCs will be unconfigured and in ``STANDBY`` state. The first step in starting up the system is to enable all CSCs. Putting a CSC in the ``ENABLED`` state requires the transition from ``STANDBY`` to ``DISABLED`` and then from ``DISABLED`` to ``ENABLED``. When transitioning from ``STANDBY`` to ``DISABLED`` it is possible to provide a ``settingsToApply`` that selects a configuration for the CSC. Some CSCs won't need any settings while others will. It is possible to check what are the available settings by looking at the ``settingVersions`` event in the EFD, using Chronograf. Alternatively, it is also possible to let the high level control scripts to decide which configuration to use. In most cases, when performing regular operations, the auto-selection algorithm should be used.

To get started with it, make sure to open jupyter lab, navigate to the ``ts_notebooks`` folder nad create a  directory with your username in that repository (e.g. ``tribeiro`` or ``pingraham``). Then, navigate inside the newly created  directory and create sub-directories as you see fit to keep the notebooks organized. Once you are happy with the location you selected for the nights operation start a clean notebook and enter the following to import the basic libraries.

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio

    from lsst.ts import salobj

    from lsst.ts.standardscripts.auxtel.atcs import ATTCS
    from lsst.ts.standardscripts.auxtel.latiss import LATISS

In the above, ``salobj`` is the high-level library that we use for basic
communication on component base. The following classes, ``ATCS`` and ``LATISS``
are developed using ``salobj`` to enable high-level operations combining multiple
components.

It is possible now to use those classes to operate with the components. To enable
them run;

.. code-block:: python

    domain = salobj.Domain()
    attcs = ATCS(domain)
    latiss = LATISS(domain)

    await asyncio.gather(atcs.start_task, latiss.start_task)

    await attcs.enable()

    await latiss.enable()

In case you want to enable the components with custom settings, it is possible to
pass them as a dictionary, e.g.;

.. code-block:: python

    await attcs.enable(settings={
                    'ataos': "current",
                    'atmcs': "",
                    'atptg': "",
                    'atpneumatics': "",
                    'athexapod': "current",
                    'atdome': "test.yaml",
                    'atdometrajectory': ""})


.. note::
    At this point one may want to setup for afternoon calibrations. This is outlined in procedure XYZ.


.. code-block:: python

    await attcs.startup()

It is safe to run this method with the telescope in most states. The task
will make sure to verify that all CSCs are in their proper state, will close the mirror
covers before opening the dome and then proceed to open the dome and so on.
