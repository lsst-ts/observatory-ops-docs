E-stop Procedures
#################

The E-stop should only be used for emergencies, but it does get pressed accidentally or occasionally used rather than powering down the drives.

The E-stop is also active whenever the Dome and/or Telescope system is power cycled.

*This needs to be turned into a directory with proper structure etc.*
