The information is constantly being updated. 
The safest way of find the procedures is to search on the docushare.

- `Startup and Shut Down Procedure for Cryo Refrigeration System <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/SUMMIT-5882>`__ 

How To Search For A Procedure
---------------
- In `Jira <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-33431?jql=text%20~%20Pathfinder%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC>`__ you find the most recent tests perfomed on the summit. Usually the followed procedure is linked in the description of the test. The reviewed procedure is a document with names LCA-#####.
- In `Docushare <https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/HomePage>`__ you can find all the procedures that have been reviewed. "Search entire site" or "Search this collection". It'll work best if it's searching the entire site, which it should do if you're on the main page. Type in LCA-##### and it should give you the document.
