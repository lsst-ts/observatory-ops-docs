Emergency Response Guide
########################

This is a basic emergency response guide organized by the type of emergency. 

- This is not a comprehensive first responder training guide.

- This does not replace safety training required to be on the summit.

- A full copy of the emergency procedures and evacuation routes are found here in `English`_ (starting on slide 19) and here in `Spanish`_ (starting on slide 19).

- It is recommended to contact the safety team to complete summit driver's training in addition to the required summit training. 

.. note::
    Observing specialists serve as the Nighttime Safety Officers if there is not a member of the safety team physically on the summit.
    If they take the decision to close the telescope or evacuate the summit for inclement weather, that decision is not negotiable.
    The priority of safety will always be given to staff first, equipment second. 

.. _emergency-response-guide-medical-emergency:

        *"Atento paramedico, habla [your name]."*
