.. _Safe-entry-to-AuxTel-Overview:

Overview
========

This document aims to provide the necessary guidelines and procedures for safely entering AuxTel. 
It covers aspects related to access during nighttime operations, ventilation, calibrations, and daytime access. 
Ensure you follow these instructions to guarantee your safety and the safety of the equipment.


Safety Equipment for All Entries
================================

Each entry to the telescope, regardless of the reason, must mandatorily use the following safety equipment:

- Helmet

- Reflective vest

- Safety shoes

   If you do not have any of these safety items, please contact the safety staff at the summit. 

.. _Safe-entry-to-AuxTel-access-during-daytime:


Access During Daytime
=====================

1. **Communication Protocols**
   
   - Announce your visit to the telescope indicating the reasons briefly via the Slack channels `#summit-auxtel <https://lsstc.slack.com/archives/C01K4M6R4AH>`__ and `#summit-announce <https://app.slack.com/client/T06D204F2/C01P41NUR1R>`__.

   - Communicate by radio on channel 3 when entering the telescope during the day and night. This action is suggested.


2. **Conditional access**

   - Ensure that no images are being taken and no work is being done in the AuxTel dome that might be disrupted upon entering the telescope.


3. **Entry door key**

   - The key to access the main entrance door to the telescope will be hanging on the right side of the door just below the fire extinguisher sign. It is strictly requested that the keys must be always left in the same place when leaving the telescope.

   .. note:: 
       Exceptionally, the entrance door will currently be left unlocked.

  

.. _Safe-entry-to-AuxTel-access-during-ventilation:

Access During Ventilation
=========================

.. note:: 

   Review the weather conditions and :ref:`weather constraints <Observing-Constraints-AuxTel-Weather-Constraints>` before taking the decision to vent.


1. **Ventilation Notification**

   - Ventilation starts with a notification via Slack channels and/or radio channel 3.



2. **Safety Precautions**

   - Ensure the windows are fully open and the fan operates at 20%.

   - Take special care not to lean on the windows or manipulate the fan while it is running.

   - On the telescope's second floor, verify that the telescope is in a horizontal position and the dome is facing opposite the Sun to maximize the ventilation system.

.. _Safe-entry-to-AuxTel-access-during-calibrations:

Access During Calibrations
==========================

.. warning::

    Access is **NOT** permitted during calibrations unless there is an issue with the system that requires attention, and images can be interrupted or are not currently being taken. 
    Ensure there are no announcements in Slack, and confirm with summit staff (daytime shift workers or an Observing Specialist) that no images are in progress.



.. _Safe-entry-to-AuxTel-access-during-night-time-operations:

Access During Night time Operations
===================================

1. **Entry Permissions**

   - Only authorized personnel and the Observing Specialist team can enter without an external permit during operations.


2. **Lighting Restrictions**
   
   .. warning:: 

    During operations, it is prohibited to turn on building lights when entering the telescope.


   .. caution:: 
        
    The use of flashlights or headlamp is permitted but they should point towards the ground and should be minimized to avoid interfering with observations.


   .. tip:: 

    Red light flashlights can be a good choice and they interfere much less than regular white light.


.. _Safe-entry-to-AuxTel-behaviour-standards:

Behavior Standards
==================

Maintain proper behavior at all times, including:

- Being close to a radio (or always carrying one) and communicating your intentions to summit staff and on Slack.
  
- Following the :ref:`Safety Gate Procedure <Safety-Gate-Procedures-Overview>` and the :ref:`E-Stop procedure <AuxTel-Non-Standard-Procedures-E-Stop-Procedure>` as needed.
  
- Locking out movement when necessary following :ref:`LOTO procedure <Auxiliary-Telescope-AuxTel-LOTO-procedure>`.


.. _Safe-entry-to-AuxTel-Emergency-Procedures:

Emergency Procedures
====================

In case of any emergency, notify immediately via **radio channel 3 for Rubin staff, or channel 1 for after hours emergencies.**
For detailed instructions on specific types of emergencies, please refer to the :ref:`Emergency Response Guide <Safety-emergency-response-guide>`.
Remember to always keep the list of :ref:`Emergency Numbers <summit-contact-numbers-emergency-numbers>` handy for any urgent situations.
