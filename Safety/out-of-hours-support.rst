Resources for help
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- If a fault happens during the night, or some new behavior appears in the system, observers and summit staff should attempt to troubleshoot to the extent of their knowledge.

- Ask for help on Slack:
    - `#summit-auxtel`_
    - `#summit-maintel`_
    - `#summit-control-room`_

Find :ref:`more information <Daytime-Nighttime-Slack-Channel-Communication-with-Summit-Personnel>` about Slack communications and the different channels being monitored.

- If no response is received from Slack, and summit staff have run out of ideas or need assistance, consult the Emergency Call List.

    - The link to the `Confluence page`_ that lists volunteers' availability is in the 1Password vault.
    - Under the comments, or on the Confluence page, the volunteers' areas of expertise are listed. 
    - If the first person doesn't answer, search for the next available person with similar expertise.
    - If no one answers, and the problem cannot be solved or worked-around, close and stow the telescope(s) by 2am, if this is possible. 

.. note::
    If any equipment is sensed to be in danger, exhaust the call list until you receive an answer, and report the problem. 
    Leave the equipment in the safest configuration possible, if you have the knowledge to do so.
